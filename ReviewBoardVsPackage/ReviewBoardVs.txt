TODO:(pv)
	* Consider fully implementing the [python] post-review in this C# app
		There is no real need to *call* post-review, when it can be directly replace.
		This would also allow this app to use the whole RB API:
			* Get titles for reviews
			* Get user review lists
			* Get review groups/users
			* Directly publish review
